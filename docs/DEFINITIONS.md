# Definitions — Trace, Result Record, Endpoint Grid

Normative companion to [SPEC.md](../SPEC.md) §4, §5.6, §5.7, §8. Minimal by
intent: fields not listed here are not part of the contract. All tunables live
in the manifest's optional `tuning` block; the defaults below are the chosen
first-run values and apply when `tuning` is absent.

## 1. Trace entry

The trace is an append-only JSONL log — the medium's durable form. One entry
per event. Entries are never edited or deleted; corrections are new entries.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| `seq` | int | Monotonic clock reading (ns) at write — total order (§4.1) |
| `anchor` | string | ID of the most recent NTP re-anchor entry (§4.2) |
| `loop` | int | Writing loop index; `0` = the runner floor itself |
| `kind` | string | One of the kinds below |
| `id` | string | This entry's stable reference (`kind-seq`) |
| `refs` | string[] | IDs this entry responds to or depends on (may be empty) |
| `class` | string? | `reasoning` or `mechanical` — present on model-call kinds |
| `data` | object | Kind-specific payload, or `{ptr: <tier-ref>}` when the payload lives in a slower tier (reference discipline, §6) |

**Kinds** (exhaustive): `task`, `result`, `verdict` (epsilon judgment:
`{tier: "hard"|"soft", pass: bool, reason}`), `mutation` (self-modification:
`{surface, before-ptr, after-ptr}`), `weight` (grid snapshot), `lifecycle`
(`{from, to}` per §5.6 states), `clarification` (§5.5), `candidate` (bootstrap
draft), `clock-anchor` (NTP result), `call` (model API request/response
metadata: endpoint, class, latencyMs, ok).

## 2. Result record

One JSON document per run, assembled by the floor at exit (any exit path).

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `manifest` | The manifest as run, including applied clarifications |
| `genesisVersion` | e.g. `genesis-v1` |
| `bootstrap` | Winning candidate verbatim + `refs` to all losing candidates |
| `lifecycle` | Ordered `lifecycle` entries: probation → certified/demoted |
| `outputs` | Declared outputs actually produced, with hashes |
| `criteria` | Each successCriterion with final pass/fail and evidence `refs` |
| `weights` | Final endpoint grid + count of `weight` snapshots in trace |
| `mutations` | Count and `refs` of all self-modifications |
| `clock` | First/last `seq`, all anchor points |
| `trace` | Path/pointer to the full JSONL trace |
| `verdict` | `completed` \| `failed` \| `halted-maxTurns` \| `halted-operator` |

## 3. Endpoint grid

### 3.1 Endpoints

Configured in the manifest (`modelEndpoints`, 1..n entries; 3 is the target —
OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic — 1 is a supported degenerate mode). Per endpoint:
`name`, `provider`, `model`, optional `baseUrl`, optional `priors`
(`{reasoning: 0..1, mechanical: 0..1}`, benchmark-derived; default `0.5`),
optional `auth`.

**Auth.** Default is a provider API key from env (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`). An endpoint may instead declare
machine OAuth:

```json
"auth": {
  "type": "oauth2-client-credentials",
  "tokenUrl": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant>/oauth2/v2.0/token",
  "clientIdEnv": "AZ_OPENAI_CLIENT_ID",
  "clientSecretEnv": "AZ_OPENAI_CLIENT_SECRET",
  "scope": "https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default"
}
```

Tokens are fetched, cached per endpoint, and refreshed 60s before expiry; a
token failure counts as an endpoint transport failure (failover applies). The
manifest names env variables, never secret values (SPEC §10). Interactive
OAuth flows (browser sign-in) are deliberately unsupported: an autonomous run
cannot block on a human. The example above pairs with
`baseUrl: "https://<resource>.openai.azure.com/openai"` for Azure OpenAI's
v1-compatible route; any OAuth2-fronted gateway works the same way.

### 3.2 Measured state (EWMA, α = `tuning.ewmaAlpha`, default **0.3**)

Per endpoint, updated from each `call` trace:

- `latencyMs` — EWMA of observed call latency
- `availability` — EWMA of transport success (1 ok / 0 fail)
- `passRate[class]` — EWMA of epsilon soft-tier verdicts on work this
  endpoint produced, kept per class

### 3.3 Score (reasoning-based routing)

For a call of class *c*:

```
score(e, c) = wPrior·priors[c] + wPass·passRate[c] + wAvail·availability
            + wLat·min(1, tuning.targetLatencyMs / latencyMs)
```

Default weight vectors (`tuning.routing`), chosen for first run:

| class | wPrior | wPass | wAvail | wLat |
|------------|--------|-------|--------|------|
| reasoning | 0.20 | 0.50 | 0.20 | 0.10 |
| mechanical | 0.10 | 0.30 | 0.20 | 0.40 |

`targetLatencyMs` default: **4000**.

Selection: highest score wins; on transport failure fall through to
next-ranked (HA). An endpoint is **down** after 3 consecutive transport
failures; retried with backoff 30s, doubling, cap 10min. With one endpoint
configured, scoring is bypassed and only health-gating applies. Loops may
propose weight-vector adjustments as ordinary tasks; epsilon judges them like
any other work (§5.7).

## 4. Certification statistics (§5.6)

Computed deterministically over the trailing window
`tuning.certWindow` = **20** completed soft-tier judgments:

- **Certify** when all hold: completion rate ≥ `tuning.certCompletion`
  (**0.90**), soft-tier pass rate ≥ `tuning.certPass` (**0.85**), hard-tier
  violations = **0** (not tunable).
- **Demote** a pinned configuration when: any hard-tier violation (immediate),
  or soft-tier pass rate over the window < `tuning.demotePass` (**0.60**).

All thresholds except the hard-tier zero are tunable via `tuning`. The
computation is pure code over `verdict` entries — no model call, no operator
judgment.

## 5. Manifest v2 delta

`modelAdapter` (string) is **replaced** by `modelEndpoints` (array, §3.1).
New optional field `tuning` (object) holds: `ewmaAlpha`, `targetLatencyMs`,
`routing` (per-class weight vectors), `certWindow`, `certCompletion`,
`certPass`, `demotePass`. Unknown `tuning` keys are a validation error.
All other v1 fields are unchanged.
